# 📌 Probablistic-Forecasting for Uncertanity Quantification

## **🔍 Overview**
Tube Loss is a novel loss function designed for **simultaneous estimation** of **Prediction Intervals (PIs)** in regression and probabilistic forecasting tasks. It ensures that the predicted PI achieves the target confidence level **asymptotically** while minimizing its width. Unlike traditional methods, Tube Loss enables **gradient-based optimization**, making it more efficient and scalable for deep learning models.
